/*
You are teaching students how to compile C programs, and you wish to share your knowledge on library creation and usage. You have created a library with multiple functions to apply special effects to image files. The source code for these functions is in a file called libimage.c. You would like to create a binary library from this file so that it can be used in multiple projects.

You then would like to use this library in your project named "superimage" in order to show some examples. The source code of this project is stored in superimage.c, the project uses the libimage.so library, and you would like to produce a program called superimage. You may assume that the libimage.so file has been moved to the /usr/lib folder, and that you may thus use the -lXXX flag at compile time instead of including the entire path.

To discuss how to create and use this library in class, you would like to create a program that simply prints the two compilation lines for these two steps. So here is your task:

Write a simple C-program with two printf commands that does the following:

print the necessary compilation command (with a simple printf) to create a libimage.so binary library from libimage.c.
print the necessary compilation command (with a simple printf) to build your "superimage" project.
*/

#include <stdio.h>
//#include "libimage.h"

int main(void)
{

    printf("gcc -std=c11 -Wall -fmax-errors=10 -Wextra -c libimage.c -o libimage.so\n");
    printf("gcc -std=c11 -fmax-errors=10 -Wall -limage -Wextra superimage.c -o superimage\n");
    return 0;
}
